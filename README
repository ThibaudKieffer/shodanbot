The goal of this script is to perform shodan query on an irc channel.

I created it with Debian Wheezy

Necessary packets are :

- Python version is 2.7 : sudo apt-get install python.
- Pip (Download and install it with instructions at https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html).
- Shodan : sudo pip install shodan (docs at https://shodan.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
- Irc library for python : sudo apt-get install python-irclib.

Launch the script with : python shodanbot.py in the good folder.
